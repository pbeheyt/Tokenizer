# pbeheyt42 Token (PBT42) - 42 Tokenizer Project

This repository contains the source code, tests, and deployment scripts for the `pbeheyt42` token, a BEP-20 compliant fungible token developed for the Ã‰cole 42 "Tokenizer" curriculum. The contract is deployed and verified on the BNB Smart Chain Testnet.

This document outlines the project's technical specifications and architectural justifications.

## Technical Architecture & Justifications

The technology stack was selected to align with industry best practices for security, reliability, and developer efficiency.

### Blockchain: BNB Smart Chain (BSC)
BSC was chosen as the target blockchain for its full EVM compatibility, high performance, and its role as the designated platform for the 42 and BNB Chain partnership. This allows the use of the standard Ethereum tooling ecosystem.

### Development Framework: Hardhat
Hardhat provides a complete, integrated environment for professional smart contract development, including a robust local testing network and an extensible plugin system. A test-driven development (TDD) approach was used to validate all contract logic before deployment.

### Contract Standard & Security: OpenZeppelin
To ensure maximum security, the contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's professionally audited and community-vetted base contracts.
-   **`ERC20.sol`**: Provides a standard-compliant BEP-20 implementation, guaranteeing ecosystem compatibility.
-   **`Ownable.sol`**: Implements a proven and secure ownership model, fulfilling a key security requirement of the project.

## Core Commands

-   **Compile Contracts**:
    ```shell
    npx hardhat compile
    ```
-   **Run Automated Tests**:
    ```shell
    npx hardhat test
    ```
-   **Deploy to BNB Testnet**:
    ```
    npx hardhat run deployment/deployToken.js --network bscTestnet
    ```
-   **Verify on Explorer**:
    ```
    # Token42 (constructor: initialOwner = your wallet or the multisig if used)
    npx hardhat verify --network bscTestnet <TOKEN42_ADDRESS> <INITIAL_OWNER_ADDRESS>

    # Token42_Bonus (constructor: initialOwner = multisig/Safe)
    npx hardhat verify --network bscTestnet <BONUS_TOKEN_ADDRESS> <SAFE_ADDRESS>
    ```
